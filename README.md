# Algerian-Forest-Fire


The Algerian Forest Fires Dataset contains meteorological and fire occurrence data collected from two regions in Algeria: Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes.

The aim of this assignment is to process and clean the dataset, generate visualizations, and derive insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This analysis will involve utilizing Linear Regression and its regularization techniques. Additionally, the assignment will include performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the model's performance. After developing the model, you will create pickle files and test the model on unseen data.
